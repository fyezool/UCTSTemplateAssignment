	abstract = {The on-going dance of merger and acquisition happening every week is hard to miss. But it has been found that most mergers and acquisition fail because of poor handling of change management. Change is the only thing that will never change so let's learn to adopt by change management. This paper will analyse all the factors that lead to change. The major reasons that lead to change are system dynamics, structure-focused changed, person-focused change, and profitability issues. The resistance to change can be attributed to the lack of communication, no clear vision, no proper reward system, confusion and frustration, force of habit, fear of unknown, fear of insecurity, loss of competency and lack of support. It presents different model that can be used for change management and different theories that can be used to handle change during M&A. It also highlights the strategies this can be followed by the leaders of the organization: Integration plan, Employee Involvement, Clear Vision, Customer Focus, HR structuring and Downsizing. The factors discussed are based on the empirical findings, case study and earlier papers. To, support that the change can be managed effectively and efficiently, the paper shows as to how change was managed in the merger of ICICI bank and Bank of Madura}

	abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between mergers and acquisitions and firm performance by running a partial least squares regression with the data of listed Chinese pharmaceutical firms from 2008 to 2016. The results show that when other conditions are unchanged, value-chain-extension mergers and acquisitions and technology-seeking mergers and acquisitions are positively related to firm performance, and that the correlation between mixed mergers and acquisitions and firm performance is not significant. In addition, this study finds that firm growth ability, firm exclusive assets, firm size, and firm age positively impact firms' performance after their mergers and acquisitions, and that corporate governance, firm property right, and firm solvency have no impact on firm performance after mergers and acquisitions. Implications of the findings are discussed}

	abstract = "Mergers and acquisitions are increasingly being used by firms to strengthen and maintain their position in the market place. They are seen by many as a relatively fast and efficient way to expand into new markets and incorporate new technologies. Yet their success is by no means assured. To the contrary, a majority fall short of their stated goals and objectives. While some failure can be explained by financial and market factors, a substantial number can be traced to neglected human resource issues and activities. Numerous studies confirm the need for firms to systematically address a variety of human resource issues and activities in their merger and acquisition activities. This article proposes a three-stage model of mergers and acquisitions that systematically identifies several human resource issues and activities. Numerous examples are offered to illustrate the issues and activities in each of the three stages. The article concludes with a description of the role and importance of the HR department and leader.}

	abstract = {We construct a measure of the pairwise relatedness of firmsâ€™ human capital to examine whether human capital relatedness is a key factor in mergers and acquisitions. We find that mergers are more likely and merger returns and postmerger performance are higher when firms have related human capital. These relations are stronger or only present in acquisitions where the merging firms do not operate in the same industries or product markets. Reductions in employment and wages following mergers with high human capital relatedness suggest that the merged firm has greater ability to layoff low quality and/or duplicate employees and reduce labor costs. We further show in a falsification test that human capital relatedness has no effect on acquiring firm returns in asset sales when little or no labor is transferred, which helps validate our measure of human capital relatedness.}

	abstract = { Many elements of qualitative research are shared between the variety of approaches, and often the overlap of epistemology, ethics and procedures encourages a generic and flexible view of this type of inquiry. This article argues that there is an essential tension between flexibility on the one hand, and consistency and coherence on the other. Such tension may encourage qualitative researchers to consider the intentions and philosophical underpinnings of the different approaches in greater depth in order to arrive at an epistemological position that can coherently underpin its empirical claims. This article is intended to encourage a more thoughtful engagement with different qualitative approaches by highlighting distinctive elements of three of the most common approaches. We suggest that the researcher be contextsensitive and flexible as well as considerate of the inner consistency and coherence that is needed when engaged in qualitative research. }

	abstract = {Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are expanding their global reach, carrying their products and brands to new and diverse markets in emerging economies. As they tailor their strategies to the local context, they have to create product and brand portfolios that match their competences with local needs. A multi-tier strategy with local and/or global brands may provide MNEs with the widest reach into the market and the potential for market leadership. However, it has to be supported with an appropriate combination of global and local resources. Foreign entrants therefore have to develop operational capabilities for the specific context, which requires complementary resources that are typically controlled by local firms. As institutional obstacles and weaknesses of local firms often inhibit the direct acquisitions, foreign investors may pursue unconventional strategies to acquire local resources. We outline the strategies for penetrating local markets through multi-tier branding and the acquisition of local firms, and offer new typologies that describe staged, multiple, indirect, or brownfield acquisitions. We illustrate them by analysing the entry and growth of Carlsberg Breweries in four very different emerging economies: Poland, Lithuania, Vietnam and China.}
